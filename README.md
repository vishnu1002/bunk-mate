**bunkmate** is a React-based web app designed to help college students manage their attendance effectively. The app calculates how many classes you can bunk without falling below a threshold attendance percentage (default 75%). Alternatively, if your attendance is below the threshold, it calculates the number of classes you need to attend to reach the desired percentage. BunkMate combines accurate calculations with an engaging user interface, making attendance tracking fun and hassle-free!

# ‚ú® Features

- **Customizable Attendance Percentage:** Select from predefined thresholds (60%, 65%, 70%, etc.) to match your requirements.
- **Dynamic Calculations:** Get real-time results based on the classes attended and total classes conducted.
- **Fun Responses:** Enjoy witty and relatable messages for both bunking and attending results.
- **GIF Animations:** Randomized GIFs add an extra touch of humor and engagement.
